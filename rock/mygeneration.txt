People try to put us down
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful cold
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Hope I die before I get old
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

It's my generation
It's my generation, baby

Why don't you all fade away
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all say
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just talkin' 'bout my generation
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

It's my generation
It's my generation, baby

Why don't you all fade away
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all say
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just talkin' 'bout my generation
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

It's my generation
It's my generation, baby

My, my, my, my generation

People try to put us down
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful cold
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Hope I die before I get old
(Talkin' 'bout my generation)

It's my generation
